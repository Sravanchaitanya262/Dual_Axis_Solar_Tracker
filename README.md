# Dual_Axis_Solar_Tracker


**Motivation** : 

  To make the Solar power plants more efficient in generating
electricity . Increase the amount of renewable energy which reduces the carbon
footprint and pollution.

**BackGround** : 
        This project aims to increase the efficiency of Solar power plant by
aligning the Solar panel at an optimum angle from time to time so
as to increase the electricity output of the power plant.


**Introduction** :
  Solar panels do not face the Sun directly at all times which
reduces the output of Solar power plants. By aligning the panel at optimum angle output can be increased.

**Methodology** :
     1. Installation of LDR sensors at four corners of the panel to measure instensity of light 
     2. Two servo motors placed perpendiculary  for rotating the panel 
     3. Eack LDR is conected to 10k ohm resistor 
     
 **Results** : 
 1.The panel rotates towards the light source at all times and thus gives the maximum output .
 2.Single-axis trackers are nearly 32.17% efficient compared to a fixed solar tracker mount panel.
 3.This trackers generate 15-16% higher annual power as compared to a static station of the same installed capacity.
 4.Dual Axis Solar trackers generate 45-50% higher power output per year, as compared to a static station of the same  installed capacity.
5.Dual-axis trackers produce 45% more energy than a fixed-roof system and up to 30% more
than a fixed-ground-mount system.
6.Triple Axis Solar trackers generate 55-68% higher power output per year, as compared to a
static station of the same installed capacity.
